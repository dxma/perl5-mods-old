TagLib Perl binding
===================

PREFACE

Almost ALL the docus are commented by the original C/C++ lib authors

Of course, I modified some parts slightly :-)

DESCRIPTION

TagLib -  a library for reading and editing audio meta data, commonly
know as tags.

Some goals of TagLib:
 - A clean, high level, C++ API to handling audio meta data.
 - Support for at least ID3v1, ID3v2 and Ogg Vorbis comments.
 - A generic, simple API for the most common tagging related functions.
 - Binary compatibility between minor releases using the standard
KDE/Qt techniques for C++ binary compatibility.
 - Make the tagging framework extensible by library users; i.e. it
will be possible for libarary users to implement  additional ID3v2
frames, without modifying the TagLib source (through the use of
Abstract Factories and such.

Because TagLib desires to be toolkit agnostic, in hope of being widely
adopted and the most flexible in licensing
TagLib provides many of its own toolkit classes; in fact the only
external dependancy that TagLib has, it a semi-sane STL implementation.
